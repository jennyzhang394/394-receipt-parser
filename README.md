394-receipt-parser
==================
Receipt Parser Project for EECS 394 


Goals for Thursday April 11
==================
1. iOS frontend that sends a picture to a web server
2. Database for a single product category, (eggs, milk). Columns can be brand, product name, price, rating (other ideas?)
3. Web server that takes request from application and responds based on database contents and request. (Send expensive eggs to server, server queries database to find there are cheaper eggs, relays that information to frontend)
